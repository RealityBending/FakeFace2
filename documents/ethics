**Project Title:** Investigating the effects of Perceived Realness on Facial Attractiveness and Trustworthiness

**Project Description**

The present study is a follow-up and replication of a previous study (ER/MHHE20/1), with the main change being the stimuli
(replacing emotional pictures with neutral faces). It aims to assess the potential modulatory effect of perceived realness of facial
stimuli on self-reported attractiveness and trustworthiness.

- Consent form

At the beginning, participants will be shown information about the study's goal (deception is involved). 
The page also emphasizes that their response and participation will be kept confidential and entirely anonymous (no IP address, or any identifiers are collected). 
Participant's data is saved only at the end of the study (giving them a chance to retract their participation till the end).

- Demographic information

In line with the study that we aim at extending, the participant will then answer a few demographic questions designed to better
identify the characteristics and representativeness of the sample (age, sex, education level, ethnicity, sexual orientation). No IP
addresses or any other identifiers will be collected.

- Questionnaires

1) HEX-ACO-18 (18 items, Olaru and Jankowsky, 2021).
2) Attitude towards artificial intelligence or AI (Makowski et al., 2023).


- Experimental stages

1) In order to explore the differences in gaze patterns between images presented as real and fake, participants will be presented with the option to enable the collection of eye gaze coordinates during the first phase using their webcam. The information page
emphasizes that the experiment does not record any actual images from the camera, it only only extracts the estimated gaze pattern on the screen using the WebGazer plugin to preserve full anonymity.
2) The participant will then undergo facial ratings in stage 1. A cover story stating that we are testing a new AI image generation model will be shown. Participants will then be shown various images of faces from the American Multiracial Face Database (AMFD, J. M.
Chen et al., 2021). Before each image a random textual cue will indicate if the image is a photograph, or if it is AI-generated (however, all the images are in fact real). After each image is shown the participant will rate the image on how beautiful, attractive and
trustworthy the presented image is. A chance for a short break will be provided mid-experiment.
3) In stage 2, participants will be re-exposed to the same images, this time asked to rate how "realistic" the images are, stating that previous word cues from stage 1 were misleading. This is to test the effect of the manipulation. The participants will then be debriefed,
with a paragraph informing them of the true purpose of the study, on the effect of "beliefs" of fakeness on attractiveness. We clarify that we are not actually testing an AI model and that all the images are in fact real, and that we apologize for the necessary deception.

- Debriefing

Participants will be given some further information at the end of the study and will be informed of the true nature of the study. There will also be multiple opportunities to give and receive feedback across the experimental trials in order to keep engagement levels high.

- Randomization

The tasks order is as follows: 2 questionnaires, followed by the first block of the facial stimuli (starting with a calibration phase if participant chooses webcam option). Then, a third questionnaire for attractiveness, beauty and trustworthiness, followed by the second 
block of faces and a realness scale. The order of the faces is randomized.

- Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). 
The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.

- Risks

There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section A**

No.
A2: Yes.
A10: Experimental manipulation is in place. Deception is used through the cover study presenting a different aim and misrepresenting the nature of the stimuli (presented as AI-generated instead of real pictures). Nonetheless, 
this is clearly explained and debriefed at the end of the experiment.

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected 
separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
- B.3: The survey will be completed online and involves two stages.
- B.4: Online survey
- B.5: No
- B.6: Yes
- B.7: Yes
- B.8: N/A
- B.9: Yes
- B.10: Yes
- B.11: Yes
    B11a: survey is anonymous so name will not be collected
- B.12: No
- B.13: Yes
